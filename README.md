# Amazon-Clone
My attempt towards developing a full stack clone of the Amazon App using React.js, with the site being deployed using FireBase and using FireStore as the database.

Implemented complete payment functionality using Stripe.js and handled authentication using Google Authentication.

## 🚀 Features

- Teachers can easily upload assignments, set deadlines, share study materials and assign them to students. The students can view & submit these assignments and add comments, if necessary. 
- Teachers can pin important resources at the very start, so that the students don't find it difficult to navigate to them at the time of need.
- Digital Board offers students a to-do list so that they can easily keep a track of what all tasks have been assigned.
- Teachers can view the submissions made by each student for a particular assignment
- By providing easy login and logout capability via Social Accounts, we have removed the hassle of remembering another set of login credentials.
- Although developed as a desktop-first application, Digital Board is fully responsive and will work on screens of all sizes.

## ⭐ Key Points
- ### Logging In 🚪
  - All users, be it teachers or students(in real life) are granted student access only. This makes them unable to create classes and subsequently assignments. This has been implemented as a security feature to prevent anyone from having teaching access.
- ### Teaching Access 👩‍🏫
  - To get teaching access, click on the Request Teacher Access button. An email will be sent to admin as well as to you, indicating that you have requested for teaching access. If everything checks out well and you indeed are a teacher, the admin will grant you teaching access within 24 hours. You need to log out and log in, for the changes to be visible.
- ### Join a Class 🏛
  - In order to join classes and submit assignments, you need to have class codes. Ask your teacher to share it with you. In the meantime you can join these classes, Class Code: b626R4 (Python), Class Code: 9Mxc1T (C++). Class codes are 6 digit alphanumeric unique strings.
- ### Assignments & Study Material 📚
  - The teacher can upload both assignments as well as study materials. Assignments need to be submitted before the deadline. For resources, there are no submissions required. The deadline associated with resources means that teacher expects you to complete them before that date.
